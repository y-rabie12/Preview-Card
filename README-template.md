## My process

At the beginning, I started by updating the all the necessary HTML tags to the content. Afterwards, I created a seperate CSS file , where I started styling the componenets. 

I first began styling the first cube image. Afterwards, I proceeded to to the style the individual text content.

Finally, I proceeded to style the overlay element and ensured that it works only when it is hovered over.


### Built with

The project was built mainly using HTML and CSS properties. One of the common CSS properties, that I've frequently used are:
- CSS Flex;
- Position property
- Box model properties
- Font properties
and many other different CSS properties.

### What I learned

The concept of how to create an overlay that is only visible when hovered over it was challenging. Thankfully, there different examples on how to  achieve that. Also centering an absolutely positioned element and make sure that it works properly  across different devices was difficult.



### Continued development

Responsiveness is the most important that I want to focus on and improve. Its a rather challenging concept.

### Useful resources

- This was very useful when I wanted to center the absolutely positioned picture found in the overlay.
- [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) 
- The examples found where very useful , when I wanted to know how overlays were created.
